âœ… API Gateway :
ðŸ”¹ An API Gateway is an essential component in a microservices architecture, acting as a single entry point for all client requests.
It provides functionalities like routing, authentication, load balancing, rate limiting, and monitoring while simplifying 
communication between clients and backend services.

âœ… Service Registry :
ðŸ”¹ The Service Registry is a crucial pattern in microservices architecture that helps services discover and 
communicate with each other dynamically. It maintains a directory of available microservices and their locations (IP addresses, ports, and metadata).

âœ… Circuit Breaker 
ðŸ”¹ The Circuit Breaker pattern is used in microservices to prevent cascading failures when a service is slow, failing, or unavailable. 
It helps improve system resilience by stopping requests to failing services and allowing them to recover before retrying.

Why Use a Circuit Breaker?
ðŸ”¹ When a service is not responding or consistently failing, even after multiple retries, then the circuit breaker will stop further attempts and instead
  invoke a fallback method.
ðŸ”¹ When the service response time exceeds a predefined threshold (i.e. it's too slow), the circuit is tripped to prevent resource exhaustion, 
   and the fallback is executed.
ðŸ”¹ While the circuit is open, all calls to the service are short-circuited (fail fast), avoiding unnecessary network or thread usage.
ðŸ”¹ After a cool-down period, the circuit enters the half-open state, allowing limited test calls to check if the service has recovered.
ðŸ”¹ If the test calls are successful, the circuit closes, and normal flow resumes. If they fail, the circuit returns to the open state.
ðŸ”¹ Circuit breakers help maintain system stability, reduce latency, and avoid cascading failures in distributed systems.
ðŸ”¹ It is commonly implemented with tools like Resilience4j, Hystrix (deprecated), or Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker in microservices architecture.

âœ… Database per Service 
In a microservices architecture, each service should own its own database. This pattern is called Database per Service. 
ensuring data autonomy, scalability, and independence for each microservice.

Why Use a Database per Service?
ðŸ”¹ Data Isolation â€“ Services donâ€™t share databases, preventing tight coupling.
ðŸ”¹ Scalability â€“ Each service can scale independently based on its workload.
ðŸ”¹ Technology Flexibility â€“ Different databases can be used for different services (e.g., MySQL for orders, MongoDB for users).
ðŸ”¹ Security & Compliance â€“ Data access is restricted to the owning service, reducing risks.
ðŸ”¹ Failure Isolation â€“ If one serviceâ€™s database fails, others remain unaffected.

âœ… CQRS :
ðŸ”¹ The CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) design pattern is used in microservices and complex systems to separate 
The read and write operations are performed on different models. This separation improves scalability, performance, and maintainability. 
especially in systems with high read/write loads or complex business logic.

Benefit	                 |      Explanation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scalability:             |  You can scale the read and write parts independently.
Performance	             |  Queries can be optimised for reads (caching, denormalisation) and writes for business logic and validation.
Separation of Concerns:  |  Business logic and data access are clearly separated.
Flexibility              |  Enables the use of different storage models (e.g., SQL for writes, NoSQL for reads).

âœ… Saga Pattern 
ðŸ”¹ The Saga Pattern is a distributed transaction management approach in microservices architecture.
It ensures data consistency across multiple services without using two-phase commits (2PC).
Two ways we can achieve this :

ðŸ”¹ What is Orchestration?
Orchestration means the automated setup, coordination, and management of complex computer systems, middleware, and services.
In the context of microservices, orchestration involves a central controller or orchestrator that manages 
how different services interact with each other. This central entity decides the order of execution and handles all communication, 
making sure each service does its job in the right sequence.

ðŸ”¹ What is Choreography?
Choreography, on the other hand, is a decentralised approach where each service works independently and communicates 
with other services through event-based messages. There is no central controller; instead, each service knows what to 
do and when to do it based on the messages it receives. This method relies heavily on predefined rules and protocols for interaction.
Example  : Kafka can be used for messages
