Here are common **Manager Round Interview Questions**, typically focused on evaluating leadership, decision-making, and cultural fit:

---

### **Behavioral & Leadership**
1. **Tell me about yourself and your journey so far.**

2. **How do you handle conflicts within your team?**
  ans - I believe conflicts are natural when different people work together, but it‚Äôs how we handle them that matters.
        Whenever there‚Äôs a conflict in the team, I prefer to stay calm and first try to understand both sides.
        I listen to everyone involved without taking sides, just to get the full picture. Then I try to bring the people 
        together to talk it out and find a common ground. I believe open and honest communication solves most issues. Also, 
        I always remind the team that we‚Äôre all working toward the same goal, so it‚Äôs better to support each other rather 
        than let small things grow into bigger problems."

3. **Describe a time you had to manage a difficult stakeholder or team member.**
  ans - There was a time when I was working on a microservice that had a tight deadline, and one of the senior stakeholders 
        kept pushing for new features even though we were in the testing phase. At first, I was a bit frustrated because it felt 
        like last-minute pressure. But instead of reacting, I asked him for 15 minutes to understand why these changes 
        were urgent. Turns out, he was under pressure from a client demo, which I wasn‚Äôt aware of. Once I knew the reason, 
        I spoke with my team, and we found a middle ground ‚Äî we delivered the critical changes that affected the demo, 
        and postponed the non-critical ones with proper timelines. It was a good lesson for me ‚Äî sometimes what looks like being 
        'difficult' is actually just someone trying to manage their own pressure. I‚Äôve learned not to take things personally and to 
        try to understand the bigger picture before reacting.

4. **How do you prioritize tasks when there are multiple deadlines?**
  ans - When I have multiple deadlines, the first thing I do is list down all the tasks and understand the urgency and 
        impact of each one. I talk to my manager or the stakeholders if something is unclear ‚Äî sometimes what seems urgent
        isn‚Äôt actually a blocker, and sometimes small tasks are linked to bigger ones. I try to break things into smaller parts and see 
        if any of them can be done in parallel or delegated. I usually follow a mix of priority and effort ‚Äî 
        for example, if a high-priority task is going to take time, I start early. Also, I stay in regular touch with the team 
        or other dependent teams to avoid last-minute surprises. And if I ever feel that it‚Äôs too tight to meet all deadlines, 
        I raise it early instead of waiting till the end.

5. **Tell me about a challenging project and how you managed it.**
  ans - One of the challenging projects I worked on was the Starbucks Outlet Service & Asset Management system. 
        We had to manage data for multiple outlets across different cities, track their equipment, schedule maintenance, and log transactions.
        The main challenge was during the migration of the frontend from Angular to ReactJS. There was pressure to 
        deliver fast without disturbing the existing functionality. Also, we had to coordinate with backend teams while 
        rewriting the UI layer. To manage this, we broke the work into small modules, prioritized the critical screens first,   
        and kept Angular and React both working side-by-side temporarily. I also created reusable components in React to
        save time. We tested each module thoroughly before moving to the next.
        Thanks to good planning and teamwork, we completed the migration smoothly with no major issues in production. 
        It helped improve the app's performance and made it easier to 
        maintainin the long term.

9. **Why do you want to join our company?**
- "I‚Äôve been following your company for a while now, and what really stands out to me is the kind of work you're doing in [specific domain or
  technology, e.g., 'cloud-native solutions' or 'data-driven decision-making']. It aligns very well with the kind of projects I‚Äôve been 
  working on and want to continue growing in.
  From what I‚Äôve seen in the job description and recent projects your team is involved in, I feel like this is a great match ‚Äî not 
  just for what I bring to the table, but also for the kind of challenges I‚Äôm looking for. The tech stack, the responsibilities, and the team 
  environment all seem like a place where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to grow.
  I‚Äôm not just looking to switch jobs ‚Äî I‚Äôm looking to be part of a company where the work is impactful and where I can see a future. 
  And from everything I‚Äôve read and heard, your company fits that picture."

10. What are your strengths?
- "One of my key strengths is that I‚Äôm a quick learner ‚Äî something that‚Äôs been true since my school days. I genuinely enjoy exploring new things,
  and this curiosity has helped me stay updated with the latest industry trends and continuously improve my skills.
  Additionally, I‚Äôm reliable, consistent, and disciplined in my work. I take full ownership of my tasks, deliver on time, and pay close
  attention to detail ‚Äî especially when writing production-ready code or dealing with edge cases. This combination of adaptability and 
  responsibility has helped me contribute effectively in fast-paced and technically challenging environments."

11. What are your weaknesses?
- "One area I‚Äôve been actively working on is being too detail-oriented, especially when it comes to reviewing code or testing. I sometimes 
  spend more time than necessary trying to perfect small things that don‚Äôt significantly impact the outcome.
  While this helps in maintaining quality, I‚Äôve realized that in fast-paced environments, it's important to balance perfection with practicality.
  So now, I consciously prioritize tasks, set time limits, and try to focus more on delivering value rather than getting caught up in the tiniest
  optimizations."

  For instance, I was once working on a Store Details Page for a client-facing portal. The main requirement was to display key store information 
  like name, address, working hours, and contact details. While the core functionality was working fine early on, I spent extra time refining 
  the alignment of elements, choosing just the right font sizes, and adjusting spacing so everything looked perfectly balanced across screen 
  sizes ‚Äî even on edge-case resolutions that weren‚Äôt part of the original requirements.
  Looking back, although the UI turned out really clean and polished, I realized I had over-invested time in visual perfection instead of 
  focusing first on delivering the MVP quickly. Since then, I‚Äôve learned to set limits, follow a more iterative approach, and come back to the 
  finer details after the essentials are in place. It‚Äôs helped me manage project timelines better while still delivering quality work."


****Challenge: One of the APIs stopped working in production*****
Context:
In our Asset & Maintenance Service, we had an endpoint:
GET /assets/by-store/{storeId}
This API was used to fetch all equipment for a particular store in the React dashboard.

‚ùå Problem:
One day, the frontend team reported that this API suddenly stopped responding ‚Äî it was either timing out or returning 500 errors.

üïµÔ∏è Root Cause:
After checking the logs and debugging:

I found that a recent DB change added a new asset_category column, but the entity class in the code was not updated.

Due to this mismatch, JPA was throwing a runtime error while mapping the result.

Unfortunately, the error was not caught properly and was returning a generic 500 Internal Server Error.

üõ† How I Fixed It:
Fixed Entity Mapping:

Added the new field assetCategory in the Asset entity class.

Synced the column with the database using JPA annotations.

Improved Exception Handling:

Wrapped the repository call inside a try-catch block.

Returned a proper custom error response (404 - Asset Not Found or 400 - Bad Request) with useful messages.

Wrote a Unit Test:

Added a test case to ensure this endpoint returns expected results with the new column.

Code Review & Hotfix Deployment:

Created a hotfix branch, reviewed, tested, and deployed it via CI/CD pipeline quickly to production.

‚úÖ Result:
The API started working again in less than an hour.

The frontend team was unblocked.

We added a checklist rule: ‚ÄúAny DB schema change must update the corresponding model‚Äù and notify all developers.

üîö Final Line (if interviewer asks follow-up):
‚ÄúThis taught me the importance of sync between DB schema and entity models in Spring Boot, and how even small changes can break a 
  microservice if error handling isn‚Äôt robust.‚Äù
