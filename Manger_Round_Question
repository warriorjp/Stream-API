Here are common **Manager Round Interview Questions**, typically focused on evaluating leadership, decision-making, and cultural fit:

---

### **Behavioral & Leadership**
1. **Tell me about yourself and your journey so far.**
2. **How do you handle conflicts within your team?**
  ans - I believe conflicts are natural when different people work together, but it’s how we handle them that matters. Whenever there’s a conflict in the team, 
        I prefer to stay calm and first try to understand both sides. I listen to everyone involved without taking sides, just to get the full picture. 
        Then I try to bring the people together to talk it out and find a common ground. I believe open and honest communication solves most issues. Also, 
        I always remind the team that we’re all working toward the same goal, so it’s better to support each other rather than let small things grow into bigger problems."

3. **Describe a time you had to manage a difficult stakeholder or team member.**
  ans - There was a time when I was working on a microservice that had a tight deadline, and one of the senior stakeholders kept pushing for new features even though we were in the 
        testing phase. At first, I was a bit frustrated because it felt like last-minute pressure. But instead of reacting, I asked him for 15 minutes to understand why these changes 
        were urgent. Turns out, he was under pressure from a client demo, which I wasn’t aware of. Once I knew the reason, I spoke with my team, and we found a middle ground — we delivered 
        the critical changes that affected the demo, and postponed the non-critical ones with proper timelines. It was a good lesson for me — sometimes what looks like being 'difficult' 
        is actually just someone trying to manage their own pressure. I’ve learned not to take things personally and to try to understand the bigger picture before reacting.

4. **How do you prioritize tasks when there are multiple deadlines?**
5. **Tell me about a challenging project and how you managed it.**
6. **Have you ever made a mistake as a leader? How did you handle it?**
7. **How do you ensure effective communication within your team?**
8. **How do you deal with disagreements between departments?**
9. **Why do you want to join our company?**
10. **What are your career goals over the next 3–5 years?**
11. **What are your expectations from your team and leadership?**
12. **How do you align your work with company values?**
